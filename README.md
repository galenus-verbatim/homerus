Verbatim demo with Homer corpus

To install, have an apache-pbp server, and  do
```shell
/var/www/html$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/galenus-verbatim/homerus.git homerus
```
Open your browser
http://localhost/homerus 

(--recursive is to grab the verbatim repo, here for homerus only, but it is possible to share it for multiple corpora, with a different navigation logic and theme for each).
